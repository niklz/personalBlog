<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In my discussions with other data-scientists about their usage of Regular Expressions (RegEx for short) I have found that a large number adopt the ‘search stack-overflow for the right one’ methodology. RegEx syntax is finicky and there’s a knowledge threshold which takes effort to break through. There’s an infamous quote on the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to argue the validity of the quote, which is a joke of course, but I prefer to see it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have a problem and a puzzle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Puzzles are more fun than problems, right? I genuinely enjoy it when I have a need to use Regular Expressions in my work, there’s sense of expression (excuse the pun) in writing the right RegEx for the job.</p>
<p>It’s useful to think of RegEx as an engine that you can bolt onto the workflow you already employ. Different platforms interact differently with the engine and also have their own syntax. In the introduction I shall keep the syntax environment-agnostic but later I will be giving examples in the R environment and hence will discuss the R ‘flavour’ RegEx.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity this post this post aims to give a basics (and not exhaustive) introduction to Regular Expressions, covering the most important concepts, showing some fun use-cases, and hopefully inspiring others to use them in their own text-processing workflows. Let’s dive in.</p>
